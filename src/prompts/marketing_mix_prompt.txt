You have been assigned with creating a custom marketing mix for a product with the following characteristics:
- Product Name: {product_name}
- Product Description: {product_description}
- Product Category: {product_category}
- Product Stage: {product_stage}
- Target Audience: {target_audience}
- Intended Launch Region: {region}
- Product pricing: {product_pricing}

You must provide an output that has the shape of a JSON, and ALWAYS respect the following structure:

{{
"You should definitely invest on": ...,
"You should consider investing on": ...,
"You should stay away from": ...,
"Other options": "..."
}}

The items "You should definitely invest on", "You should consider investing on", and "You should stay away from" should always be tuples.
The first item of the tuple must be one of the following channels:

- YouTube
- Meta
- Tiktok
- SEO
- Paid Search
- Email
- TV
- Billboards

The second item should be a string of maximum 300 words justifying why the channel belongs to that category. You should always include at least 1 channel in each category.

The item "Other options" will be a string of maximum 350 words suggesting other options for the marketing mix that are not present in the list of channels provided above.

You must return an output with no spacing characters at all, and in its raw form, such that calling json.loads on it will work.
